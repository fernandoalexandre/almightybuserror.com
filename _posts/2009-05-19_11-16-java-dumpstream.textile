title: "Snippet.Java: Dump InputStream to OutputStream"
tags:

This piece of code keeps reading 1024 bytes from the _InputStream_ and writing to the _OutStream_ until the _read_ function returns an error value (-1) which means there is not anything else to read.

<pre><code class="prettyprint lang-Java">protected void dumpStream( InputStream in, OutputStream out )
throws IOException {
	byte[] arr = new byte[1024];
	int n;
	do {
		n = in.read( arr );
		out.write( arr, 0, n );
	} while (n != -1);
}</code></pre>
