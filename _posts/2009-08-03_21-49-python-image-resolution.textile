Using "PIL(Python Image Library)":http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ it is possible to get the width and height of a image using the property _size_.

The following example will take an undefined number of arguments and print all the resolutions:

<pre><code class="prettyprint lang-py">import Image
import sys
def main():
    argv = sys.argv[1:]
    if (len(argv) == 0):
        print "No file given!"
    else:
        for name in argv:
            img = Image.open(name)
            print name + ": %d %d" % img.size
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>
