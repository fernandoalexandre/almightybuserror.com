    <h2>What is a bus error?</h2>
    <p>
    From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error:">Wikipedia</a>:
    <blockquote><span class="qstart">&#8220;</span>In computing, a <strong>bus error</strong> is generally an attempt to access memory that the CPU cannot physically address. Bus errors can also be caused by any general device fault that the computer detects. A bus error rarely means that computer hardware is physically broken - it is normally caused by a bug in a program's source code.<span class="qend">&#8221;</span></blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Bus error</strong> is a common error when learning C in MacOS, it appears in the same situations as <strong>Segmentation fault</strong> in Unix systems.
